1. Suppose the String s is declared and initialized as follows:

```java
String s = "elementary";
```

What String would be returned by the method call s.substring(1, 4);?

> `lem`

2. What will be printed by the following code?

```java
String s = "Animal";
System.out.println(s.indexOf("al"));
```

> `4`

3. Suppose s1 and s2 are Strings and the following code is run:

```java
s1 = s1.toLowerCase();
s2 = s1.toUpperCase();
System.out.println(s1.compareTo(s2));
```

What should be the expected output?

> A positive value is printed
