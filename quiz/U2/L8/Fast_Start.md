1. How would you declare a variable `x` of type `double` and set it equal to `25.25`?

> `double x = 25.25;`

2. Given the following code, what would be the value stored in the Double object referenced by the variable d?

```java
int x = 7;
Double d = new Double(x);
```

> 7.0

3. What would be printed by the following code?

```java
double y = 4.7;
Integer n = new Integer((int) y);
System.out.println(n);
```

> 4

4. Which code shows an example of autoboxing being used correctly? 

> `Double m = 2.5;`
