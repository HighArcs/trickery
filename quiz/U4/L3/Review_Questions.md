1.  When might it be more helpful to use a for loop instead of a while loop? 

> When the loop is going to run a set number of times. 

2. Choose which three values should replace the blanks in the for loop so that it loops through the numbers: 2 4 6 8 10. 

Note that the choices will fill in the three blanks in the order which they appear.

```java
for (int i = ____; i ____; i _____) {
  System.out.print(i + " "); 
}
```

> `2`, `<= 10`, `+= 2`

3. What is output?

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```

> 1 2 3 4 5

4. What is output by the following code segment?

```java
for (int i = 12; i >= 5; i -= 3) {
  System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```

> 12 9 6
