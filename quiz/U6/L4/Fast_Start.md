1. Assume you have the following array:

```java
String[] a = { "armadillo", "baboon", "crocodile", "dolphin" };
```

Which of the following would change the element which currently has the value "armadillo" to upper case?

> `a[0] = a[0].toUpperCase();`

2. Assume you have the following array:

```java
int[] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
```

How would you increment the element with the value 4?

> `a[3]++;`

3. How would you create a random variableÂ x greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1? 

> `double x = Math.random();`
