1. This segment of code is found in every program we have made up to this point - though normally it is part of the starter code.  Think back to the code practices, choose the correct key words in the correct order that should be used to fill in the blanks:

```java
______ ______ ______ main (String[] args)
{

}
```

> `public`, `static`, `void`

2. A special value that means “no object” is called: 

> null

3. Consider the following code:

```java
String w = "potato";
if (w.indexOf('e') == -1) {
  w = w + "es";
} else {
  w = w + "s";
}
System.out.println(w);
```

What is output?

> potatoes
