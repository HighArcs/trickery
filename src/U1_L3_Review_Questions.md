1. Which line of code correctly declares and initializes the variable x to a value of 4?

> `int x = 4;`

2. What is wrong with the code below?

```java
int x = 67.21;
```

> You cannot store a `double` in an `int` variable.

3. Different data types can store different amounts of data. In the options below, which has the data types listed in order, from smallest to largest? 

> `boolean`, `int`, `double`, `String`

4. What data type should you use to hold the average of your test scores? 

> `double`

5. What is the largest value you can store in an `int` variable?

Check the java documentation to find the answer: [Official Java documentation on datatypes](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html).

> 2,147,483,647

6. Consider the following code:

```java
int y = 2147483647;
y = y + 1;
System.out.println(y);
```

What number does the program print when compiled and run? Hint: think about the max value you just looked up in your previous answer.

> -2147483648

7. Which of the following are examples of primitive data types? 

> `double`
>
> `boolean`
>
> `int`

8. Which of the following correctly describes the difference between reference data types and primitive data types?

> Primitive data types are stored directly in a variable, while reference data type variables store a memory reference to where the data is stored.
