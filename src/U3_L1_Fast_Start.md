1.  Which of the following single lines of code could be used to declare a new variable named x and store the integer value 72 using this variable? 

> Integer x = 72;
> 
> int x = 72;
>
> Integer x = new Integer(72);

2. You are taking temperature readings and need to convert them from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The formula is:

Deduct 32 from the Fahrenheit number, then multiply the result by 5, and finally divide by 9.

Consider the following two lines of code:

```java
double fahrenheit  = scan.nextDouble();
double celsius = /* missing code*/ ;
```

Which of the following could replace `/* missing code*/` so the calculation works correctly?

> `(fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9`

3. What will be printed by the following code segment if the user enters 15 and 6 in that order?

```java
int x = scan.nextInt();
int y = scan.nextInt();
System.out.print(y / x);
```

> 0
